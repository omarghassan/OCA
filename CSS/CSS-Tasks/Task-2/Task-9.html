        <h1>Amblyopia(Lazy Eye)</h1>

        <div class="div1">
            Amblyopia (also called lazy eye) is a type of poor vision that usually happens in just 1 eye but less
            commonly in both eyes. It develops when there’s a breakdown in how the brain and the eye work together, and
            the brain can’t recognize the sight from 1 eye. Over time, the brain relies more and more on the other,
            stronger eye — while vision in the weaker eye gets worse. <br>

            It’s called “lazy eye” because the stronger eye works better. But people with amblyopia are not lazy, and
            they can’t control the way their eyes work. <br>

            Amblyopia starts in childhood, and it’s the most common cause of vision loss in kids. Up to 3 out of 100
            children have it. The good news is that early treatment works well and usually prevents long-term vision
            problems.
