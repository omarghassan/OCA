            Foxes are small-to-medium-sized omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. They
            have a flattened skull; upright, triangular ears; a pointed, slightly upturned snout; and a long, bushy tail
            ("brush").

            Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true fox" group of genus Vulpes. Another 25 current or extinct
            species are sometimes called foxes â€“ they are part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes or
            an outlying group, which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox.

            Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. The most common and widespread species of fox is the red
            fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies. The global distribution of foxes, together with
            their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore
            in many societies around the world. The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit
            in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New
            World.
