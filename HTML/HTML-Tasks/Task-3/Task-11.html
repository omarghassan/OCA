        <i>4 out of 5 stars</i>
        <p>
            From direcror <b>Vicki Fleming</b> comes the heartwarming tale of a boy named Pete (Trent Dugson) and his dog Rover (voiced by Brinson Lumblebrunt). You may think a boy and his dog learning the true value of friendship sounds familiar, but a big twist sets this flick apart: Rover plays basketball, and he's doggone good at it. <br> <br>

            This movie has everything you could ask for:
            <ul>
                <li>Basketball</li>
                <li>A dog</li>
                <li>Nail-biting suspense</li>
            </ul>

            While it may not have been necessary to include all 150 minutes of Rover's championship game in real time, Basketball Dog will keep your interest for the entirety of its 4-hour runtime, and the end will have any dog lover in tears. If you love basketball or sports pets, this is the movie for you. <br> <br>
