    <h1>Linear Equations</h1>
    <p>
        An equation that has maximum degree one is known as Linear Equations. The graph of it is a straight line. <br> <br>

        For example:
        <ul>
            <li>y = 8x - 2</li>
            <li>ax<sub>1</sub> + bx<sub>2</sub> + cx<sub>3</sub> = 9</li>
        </ul>

        are some of the examples of a linear equation in two and three variables. <br> <br>

        Slope of intersections of two Linear equations: <br>
        y<sub>1</sub> = mx<sub>1</sub> + a and y<sub>1</sub> = mx<sub>2</sub> + b <br>
        for the points P(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) and Q(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) is: <br>
        <b>
            m = (y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub>) / (x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>)
        </b>
    </p>
