    <h1><u>What is the introduction of math?</u></h1>
    <p>
        Mathematics is the <mark>science and study of quality, structure, space, and change.</mark> Mathematicians seek
        out patterns,
        formulate new conjectures, and establish truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and
        definitions. <br> <br>

        There is debate over whether mathematical objects such as numbers and points exist naturally or are human
        creations. The mathematician <b>Benjamin Peirce</b> called mathematics "<u>the science that draws necessary
            conclusions.</u>"
        <mark>Albert Einstein</mark>, on the other hand, stated that "<u>as far as the laws of mathematics refer to
            reality, they are
            not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality</u>". <br> <br>

        <u>Today, mathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in many fields, including natural
            science,
            engineering, medicine, and the social sciences.</u> Applied mathematics, the branch of mathematics concerned
        with
        application of <b>mathematical knowledge</b> to other fields, inspires and makes use of new mathematical
        discoveries
        and sometimes leads to the development of entirely new disciplines. Mathematicians also engage in pure
        mathematics, or mathematics for its own sake, without having any application in mind, although practical
        applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.

    <h1><u>Introduction to Chemistry</u></h1>
    <p>
        <mark>Chemistry</mark> is the study of matter and the ways in which different forms of matter combine with each other. <u>You
        study chemistry because it helps you to understand the world around you</u>. Everything you touch or taste or smell
        is a <b>chemical</b>, and the interactions of these chemicals with each other define our universe. <mark><i>Chemistry forms the
        fundamental basis for biology and medicine</i></mark>. From the structure of proteins and nucleic acids, to the design,
        synthesis and manufacture of drugs, chemistry allows you <br> <br>

        <del>The principles of chemistry are quite varied and are essentially important which include brain functioning,
        computer operations, weather patterns, chemical industries, manufacturing fertilizers, acids, alkalis, salts,
        drugs, soaps, etc.</del> Chemistry also acts as a major determinant in meeting the human needs for food, healthcare
        products, and also other <mark>materials</mark> are aimed at improving the life's quality.
