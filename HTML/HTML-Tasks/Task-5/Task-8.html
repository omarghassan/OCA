            React is a popular JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components, making code more modular and easier to maintain. React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render components, resulting in improved performance. Its component-based architecture and declarative syntax make it a powerful tool for building dynamic and interactive web applications. React is widely used in the industry and has a strong community support, making it a go-to choice for modern web development.
