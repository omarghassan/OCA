        <p>
            1) The main difference between HTML and CSS is that while HTML defines the structure of web pages, CSS is used to style those pages with a variety of different features. If we think of HTML code as the skeleton of a web page, CSS would be its skin.

            2) <u>HTML consists of text contained within HTML tags</u>, while <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank">CSS</a> is made up of declaration blocks and selectors. Where HTML gives a web browser display information of various tags, <u>CSS enhances that information to the browser</u> by adding styling to those HTML tags. <br> 
            <u>CSS can be used inside an HTML document</u>, but HTML cannot be used inside a CSS sheet. <br>
            <u>CSS is used for presentation and visual effect</u> — to manipulate colors, fonts, and backgrounds, add visual style to sites, prepare images, specify margins and borders, and much more — while HTML is not.
